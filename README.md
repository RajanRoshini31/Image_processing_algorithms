# Image Processing Algorithms Collection

This repository contains implementations and experiments of various image processing algorithms and techniques. Each python notebook focuses on a specific image processing task or filter, demonstrating practical applications with sample images.

## Folder Structure and Algorithms

- **Adaptive_Filtering/**  
  Implementation of adaptive filtering techniques to enhance image quality by adjusting filter parameters based on image characteristics.

- **Bilateral_Filtering/**  
  Edge-preserving smoothing filter that reduces noise while maintaining sharp edges.

- **Bitwise_Operations/**  
  Bitwise operations on images such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT for masking and combining images.

- **Canny_Sobel/**  
  Edge detection techniques combining Canny and Sobel operators for detecting image boundaries.

- **Colormap_Trial/**  
  Experiments with various colormaps to enhance image visualization.

- **Convert_Red_to_Blue/**  
  Color channel manipulation by swapping or converting red channel pixels to blue.

- **Image_Equalization/**  
  Histogram equalization techniques to improve contrast in images.

- **Face_Detection/**  
  Face detection using classical algorithms (e.g., Haar cascades) or deep learning models.

- **Erosion_and_Dilation/**  
  Morphological operations to remove noise (erosion) and fill gaps (dilation) in binary images.

- **Filtering_Techniques/**  
  Implementation of various filtering methods such as mean, median, Gaussian filters, etc.

- **Hough_Transformation/**  
  Hough transform for detecting lines, circles, and shapes in images.

- **HSV_and_LAB/**  
  Color space conversions and processing using HSV and LAB color models.

  Image channel interchange and manipulation for various effects.

- **LPF_HPF/**  
  Low Pass and High Pass Filtering for frequency domain image enhancement.

- **Mean_Median_Gaussian/**  
  Filtering methods using mean, median, and Gaussian kernels for smoothing and noise reduction.
